# MVP Impact

See `LO2_MVP_SUMMARY.md` for the full narrative; the bullets below capture the quick headlines.

- **LO2Loader** (`loglead/loaders/lo2.py`) now understands the LO2 run/test/service layout, builds event and sequence tables, and plugs into the `BaseLoader` lifecycle so the rest of LogLead can consume OAuth2 logs without custom glue.
- **Demo pipelines** (`demo/run_lo2_loader.py`, `demo/LO2_samples.py`, `demo/lo2_phase_f_explainability.py`) walk from raw logs to features, anomaly scores, and explanations, giving researchers an executable, tunable flow instead of loose snippets.
- **Documentation** (`LO2_MVP_SUMMARY.md`, `docs/LO2_e2e_pipeline.md`, `docs/LO2_enhanced_exports.md`) captures architecture, step-by-step CLI usage, and feature export rationale, so teammates can reproduce the workflow and understand design decisions.
- **Result tooling** (`tools/lo2_result_scan.py`, `result/lo2/**`) standardises how experiments are saved, scanned, and shared, closing the loop from ingestion to explainability artefacts.
